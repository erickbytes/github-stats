# github-stats

In this repo, there are 2 Python scripts for querying data via the [PyGithub](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) module.

<br />

**repo_traffic.py** returns clones, views and referrers of your own Github repos.

<br />

**stargazers.py** returns the stargazer count of any Github repo.

<br />

**Install Python Libraries**

```
pip install PyGithub
pip install pandas
pip install tqdm
```

**Ubuntu Shell Authorization Token**

You'll need to create a Github token. Once you have a token, fill it in and then
run this command to set an environment variable:
```
export access_token=your_github_token
```
Then edit the script with your custom repo names and run the script.

<br />

**Troubleshooting "Must have push access to repository"**
```
github.GithubException.GithubException: 403
{"message": "Must have push access to repository",
"documentation_url": "https://docs.github.com/rest/metrics/traffic#get-top-referral-sources"}
```
I fixed this error by going to ["Developer Settings"](https://github.com/settings/tokens) > "Fine Grained Token" > Create New Token or Edit and then setting "Repository permissions" > "Content" > "Read and write".

**curl Github API Example**

This is another way to get repo data from the [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/metrics/traffic#get-repository-clones):
```
curl -L \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_github_token" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/{username}/{repo_name}/traffic/clones
```
